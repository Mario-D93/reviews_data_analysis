      "I was looking for some time for the good Python course for beginners and I wanted to find something with real projects in it. After checking the contents and reviews of the courses I decided to choose this course. First I was concerned about the strange accent of the trainer but after few lectures, I got used to it and it's actually really clear English. Way that Ardit is explaining things is really clear, he is also going forward in quite slow tempo at the beginning which is good, later on he is speeding up and so does the knowledge of the student as well. Don't skip the basics -section at the beginning even if you pass the test. These lectures are really good even if you know something about Python. There's theory and then exercises that are supporting the theory. And structure is really well built. Now I have done few projects and it seems that in this course you will learn the basics and also what you can do with Python. And then later on you can focus on the areas that you want to learn more. Only minus is that some of the recordings are quite old (from 2015-2016 I believe). But if something has changed since, then there's usually comments in the course that tell what has changed since the recording was made. Also some sections have been added afterwards to support the course. So far this is the best Udemy course that I have done. And I have done around 10 in the past.\n",

Furthermore  there are no exercises!!! When the courses get's into more advanced stuff, he films on the spot while he writes code and you have to pause the video and copy what he does and back and forth, there is no way of learning something like this!!! This gets really boring fast!!! He should first present something simple and then provide exercises for the student to work on his own!! I have to mention the terrible accent and deep draging voice of the teacher that makes it even more boring and difficult to understand the lessons, it's more suitable for a hypnotist but he cannot help it I guess. Try another Course.\n",

      "\n",
      "Yes, great course so far.  Ardit tackles Python in a good way that is different from other tutors as he doesn't start at raw basics like x == y .. he uses real world programs then dissects the program into it's core components line for line.   For me, this is very helpful as I can relate the course content to real world output.  I can see how the programs start, end and how they are put together.  You don't necessarily need to understand everything, but starting with the whole concept and breaking it down is nice.  Ardit's accent is a little unusual at first - but I know English isn't his first language but his English is very good so no problem, just takes a few lectures to understand the phonetics.  So, Ardit uses real-world teaching methods and contextualises the course content so we are working in a more practical way.\n",
      "Just to update .. Ardit has since updated the course and it is even better!  I'd like to mention that for me, if I play Ardit talking at 1.5x this is perfect.  In fact it makes his short lectures so much on point it really is probably the best lecture type course I am currently busy with.  I'm doing many Python courses just now and Ardit is one of my top 3 lecturers.  Again, because the course is broken down into short manageable videos that are action specific and there are many short practice tasks/quizzes/exercises that are key.  So many courses get the questions too complicated and end up making the student frustrated.  Ardit avoids this and his course is perfect watched at 1.5 x speed.  Awesome stuff!\n",
      "\n",
      "I'd also like to add, I find his explanations and development of both front end and back end simple and clear.  What I really enjoy is how Ardit stays on point with his teaching direction.  We don't jump from topic to topic endlessly and needlessly.  We walk through the programs from start until completion and I'm learning so much about all the stages of development I'm thoroughly enjoying his presentation.  Can't wait for Ardits next course so I can finish that too.  Thank you Ardit, great man!\n",

      "This is not how a course quality should be. The course is novel in the sense that there is no other course on Bokeh, but totally disappointed.

      "The content is great but I'm having trouble understanding his speech. I speak English as my native language. With his heavy accent and monotone voice, I'm only able to pick up a word occasionally. I have a background in programming many other computer languages, so reading the sample code allows me to understand the concepts being presented somewhat. If his voice was clear, it would improve the course tremendously,\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Things I don't like about this course:\n",

      "1. The instructor keeps repeating very obvious things, giving me the impression that he doesn't have in mind what he was about to say. He also comes back and forth a lot when explaining the code so it feels disorganized.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The bad smell of his code. Just look at the final code of app 1, why repeating the \"get_close_matches()\" several times when you can wrap it up in a variable or function? As a programmer myself, I simply can't stand poor code like this.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. The instructor's accent. It's even more irritating for me given that he keeps talking about unimportant things.\n",
      "\n",
      "Things I like about this course (the only thing that still keeps me learning despite all things I don't like):\n",
      "\n",
      "1. It successfully shows the broadness of what Python can do.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "My opinion: this course is perfect for someone who's just learned basis and want to make further use with Python.\n",
      "This course teaches real applications such as web apps, web crawling, even automatic emailing,... which are really mainstream useful in real-life.\n",
      "About the number \"10\", actually I would call them \"skills\" more than \"applications\" because they are small-scaled and probably a small function of a real-life application.\n",
      "My tips when you consider buying this course:\n",
      "1. Learn ahead Python as much as possible.\n",
      "2. Get used to finding solutions on google.\n",
      "3. turn speed of video to 1.5x if you feel frustrated by slow-speaker like me, :p  The teacher is German (as I guess) and he has some small accent (words like \"hour\" or \"Linux\") in it but wholly speaking his communication is more than fine. \n",
      "4. He has a really nice and active assistant and a lot of helpful learners in the course, so, take advantage of the Q&A even when you pass the lesson, still read a bit and see some worth-reading comments. This section is not only for asking, but sharing as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The mentor has a wierd accent which is not understandable. Also he doesn’t stick to a particular tooic while explaining concepts. He mixes too many concepts together which makes it quite difficult to understand.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I like his accent, keeps me focused lol. He is very detailed and explains line by line what happening in each code project. He has two work spaces open, on the left is the project code, and the right is a terminal. He runs lines and examples in terminal. I have a work space open as well that I keep floating above his so that I can run code and experiment as well.\n",

      "This course makes for an awesome jump, from the beginner/entry level courses to buulding actual applications. I started Python on Codeacademy (excellent course, definitely recommended) and continued to Michele Pratusevich's \"Practice Python\" blog. After finishing those, I was still struggling to understand how to make something actually useful in Python. This course taught me many things I wanted to know (graphic interfaces, creating executables etc) and many more that I didn't know I wanted to know(Image Proccesing, Face Recognition, Databases, Working with Websites etc)! As for the course itself, it's being kept up to date continuously. Also Ardit really does read and answer every question in a reasonable timeframe. \n",

      "I understand that I wasn't a complete beginner when I started the course and my previous \"experience\" did help me, but even if you are starting from scratch you can actually learn everything without prior knowledge, especially with the recent addition of extra lessons at the start of the course.\n",
      "\n",
      "I didn't gave 5 stars simply because I believe that there is always room for improvement. Nothing specific to complain, just sayin'. I did ran the whole course at 1.25-1.5 speed, as I found the pace a llittle slow, but it's definetely not Ardit's fault, he's not a native speaker. With that being said, I find his accent good enough, although other people seem to disagree.\n",

It's exercise based, and the author actually encourages you to pause and try out the code for yourself to understand what your learning. My only negative complaint is his accent seems a bit foreign for an English course, though you can still comprehend everything he says.\n",

The value you will receive is well worth the small investment of money and time.  Should you purchase the course while it is on sale, I think you will agree that it is a steal!  If you are looking to get into Python or are already a seasoned developer, you should strongly consider this course and all that it has to offer.\n",

      "Dieser Kurs bietet eine kurze, knackige Zusammenfassung der Python Grundlagen. Außerdem wird eines der Kernelemente von Python häufig in Szene gesetzt und ihre Wichtigkeit unterstrichen: Bibliotheken! Man erhält dadurch einen kurzen Einblick in die unzähligen Möglichkeiten, die einem diese Programmiersprache verschafft. Nichts desto trotz wird es notwendig sein, sich mit den einzelnen Teilen näher auseinanderzusetzen. Der Kurs gibt zumindest eine gute Richtung vor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Empfehlen würde ich den Kurs dennoch tatsächlich eher Personen, die bereits Programmiererfahrung haben. Die hohe Geschwindigkeit des Kurses und der Akzent des Dozenten sind nicht jedermanns Sache. Der Inhalt ist zwar relativ linear aufgebaut, aber dennoch wirken manche Teile etwas verloren. Mehr Details und Kontext sind wünschenswert.\n",

      "This course provides a short and firm summary of Python fundamentals. In addition, one of Python's core elements is often mentioned and its importance underlined: libraries! This gives you a brief insight into the countless possibilities of this programming language. Nevertheless, a closer look at the different parts is inevitable. But the course offers a good starting point.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would rather recommend this course to people who already have programming experience. The high pace of the course and the accent of the lecturer may be problematic. The content is relatively linear, but some parts seem a bit lost. More details and context are desirable.\n",

      "\n",
      "Being a newbie to Python (background in PHP), I want to learn all the possible uses of Python before I decide the type of Python programming that I would like to specialize in. This course will give you a broad understanding of the capabilities of Python. \n",
      "\n",
      "If you read the negative reviews of this course, you will see that people all have the same comment; the course does not go in depth with topics.\n",
      "\n",
      "If there you have a specific need, or are looking to peel off all the layers that Python has to offer, this course if not for you. I would highly recommend looking at other courses that are geared towards what you are looking to accomplish (Web Design, Data Analysis, etc). \n",
      "\n",
      "I've had instructors in other courses that were extremely difficult to follow along.  This instructor has a German (I think?) accent, but you can definitely understand him. \n",
      "\n",
      "What makes this course great is that he gives you quizzes in between important topics, which give you a better understanding of where you're at in the course. He will also outline areas that he feels you should revisit. \n",
      "\n",
      "He also gives you exercises, that are a bit challenging. I highly recommend you take the time to try the exercises, especially if you are a newbie to programming. \n",
      "\n",
      "You need to get into the mindset of a developer, and be able to put what you've learned to the test. You won't have an instructor telling you how to do something in the real world, and the only way you get better is by practicing. What you get out of this, or any course, is based on how much you put in. This is the best advice I can give.\n",
